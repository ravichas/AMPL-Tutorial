In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in triplicate within the same experiment.",Phenylcyclopropylamine derivatives and their medical use,,PATENT,

While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline.

Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in triplicate within the same experiment.",Phenylcyclopropylamine derivatives and their medical use,,PATENT,

Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline.
